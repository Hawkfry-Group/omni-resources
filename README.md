# Omni Resources

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a community-led initiative and is not officially maintained by Omni. For official documentation, please visit [Omni's official documentation](https://docs.omni.co/).

A community-curated collection of guides, cheatsheets, and best practices for Omni users of all levels. This repository serves as a collaborative resource hub.

## üîÑ How This Works

This repository works alongside the [Omni Community Forum](https://community.omni.co/). While the forum is great for discussions, Q&A and sharing how to's, this repository serves as a place for community members to collaboratively develop and maintain code, documentation, and resources. Think of it as a shared workspace where we can:

- Co-develop and version control
- Maintain and improve code examples
- Create and refine templates
- Build comprehensive guides

## üìö How This Differs from Official Documentation

While [Omni's official documentation](https://docs.omni.co/) provides the authoritative source of truth, this repository serves a different purpose:

- **Community-Driven Examples**: Real-world examples and patterns from actual users
- **Extended Use Cases**: Solutions for edge cases and advanced scenarios
- **Workarounds & Tips**: Community-discovered workarounds and optimization tips
- **Version Control**: Track and contribute to documentation improvements
- **Rapid Updates**: Community can quickly add new content without official review cycles
- **Collaborative Development**: Work together on documentation and code examples
